<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Charles Henry C. I am a graduate of the university of Portharcourt, Choba, Rivers State, Nigeria. 
  I graduated from the Mechanical Engineering with a Second class upper division. i wasn't the best in my class but 
  i was among the most intelligent and smartest in the department of Mechanical Engineering U2018. i won an award of
  the most Fashionable male student in mechanical Engineering. i wasn't well known by lecturers but majority of my lecturers 
  knew me. during exams i seat around the front seats, never liked the back seat. and yeah i am a serious student who entered
  mechanical engineering to focus on Automobile engineering. i am Engineer Henry</p>

<p>Based on the skills i've learnt while in school for six years. i started with fashion design, i learnt to sew male wears in 
  2018 - and yeah i'm still a fashion designer. during the years of learning fashion, i worked as a manager in the company, 
  i had two sewing machines, one was in school while the other was at home - my family house at Anambra state. in 2020 i learnt 
  computer aided design (AUTOCAD). i was good at it, i did alot of project work with it, but after my laptop was stolen i stopped 
  for a while hoping that whenever i get a new laptop i will continue. then around 2021 i started programming - i heard about it ]
  in my second year but i was still at Design. i started with the regular 'Hello World' in phyton. that went on. then from python i 
  entered Data science in my third year around 2023. then i progressed on and on. in my fourth year, we  were thought Solidworks - 
  another CAD software used by mechanical engineers for design and simulations. so i took it seriously. though it wasn't that hard for 
  me because i did autocad before. so i was one of the best in Solidworks, in my department. then during my IT period in my fourth year 
  i narrowed my tech learning to Data Analysis - needed to go from data anaysis then i dive into Data Science. then during my fifth year 
  i registered for an online course, Machine learning because i needed my final year project to be a machine learning project. i was 
  progressing speedily at it, created model and during the time of the project, there was a constraint. but i kept the machine learning
  on. then when i graduated, i had a new plan of becoming an enterprenuer, so i had to go into web development because it will help me in 
  my business to create my own website. so other programs i was doing was put on hold. including making clothes and designing. i didn't 
  push further on data science or data analysis or machine learning - though i have knowledge of them. but i chose web development because 
  it will be helpful and benefincial to me in my business. then i continued Computer Aided Design because i am an Engineer. we deal on designs
  and simulations too.</p>

<p>Outside accademics, i am a good thinker, a jovial person, fun to relate with. i am 70% intovert and 30% extrovert. i have hubbies too, 
  like playing basketball, watching movies, working out(calisthenics). i am a lover of Christ (He's the author and finisher of my Faith).
  i love communication, i have a best friend, her name is Mercy. i play drums, i play football too and i play chess (my best piece is the queen and 
  knight). i love video games. i love to read self help books. i read the bible too, working towards consistency. 
  i am a dreamer, a warrior and a winner, i am Engineer Henry the web developer the CAD designer and the Enterprenuer</p>
